# Koks 4.1.0 22w02a
Koks was (?) a multi-server client developed for a long time and for a short time was sold on haze.yt.

This is source-code was (as always) released by Kroko on MasterOf13FPS on the 26th of January, 2022, afterwhich he quickly deleted it. It was re-uloaded the day after.

I don't really have much to say about this, it's pretty good ig.
